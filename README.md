Loan Approval Prediction Project Overview
Objective:
To predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant details like income, credit history, loan amount, and more. 
This involves both data analysis and a machine learning model, using logistic regression for binary classification.

Dataset: Loan Prediction Dataset

Features:
Gender: Male/Female
Married: Yes/No
Education: Graduate/Not Graduate
ApplicantIncome: Applicant's income
LoanAmount: Loan amount requested
Credit_History: 1 (Yes) or 0 (No)
Loan_Status: Target variable (Y = Approved, N = Rejected)

Steps to Build the Project
1. Data Loading
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the data to find patterns and insights.
Handle missing values and outliers.

3. Feature Engineering
Convert categorical variables into numerical form using encoding techniques.

4. Splitting the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. Logistic Regression Model
Train the logistic regression model.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.
